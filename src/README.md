This app is a simple React component that renders a grid of toggleable boxes. It is an exercise from the Scrimba React course, and it demonstrates the use of hooks and props in React. When a box is clicked, the color of the box is toggled between two states (on and off) based on the on property of the box object. The useState hook is used to manage the state of the boxes, and the map method is used to generate the boxes dynamically based on the state. The Box component takes in two props: on and toggle, and the App component defines a toggle function that handles the state changes when a box is clicked.
